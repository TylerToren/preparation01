A students grades are a measurement of how well they are performing in school and how effective their teachers are at helping them learn. The competitive nature of the grading
scale is meant to encourage students to put in a maximum amount of effort. Since professors are evaluated based on the grades in their classes, it also encourages them to come
up with new ways of getting students to retain information. This means that grades are based on a combination of intelligence and effort. As Kohn's article discusses, however, it is
far from the perfect system.

A class where I feel that my grades did not reflect what I learned is the Tax Law class I took during my Junior year at Aquinas. The class itself was brutally difficult and required more
effort than all my other classes combined. While I have nothing against classes that are designed to challenge students and promote new ways of thinking, this class felt unfair in many ways. 
Nearly all of the problems we dealt with gave us a list of income or expense related items and asked us to determine which of these items were supposed to be taxed and
for how much. While this may sound simple enough, the rules we needed to memorize were spread out across over 1,000 pages of text. Not only that, but most of the problems had more
than one way in which to interpret them. Whenever we went over a problem in class, for example, almost everyone would come up with a different answer. Each test we took only
saw a few classmates score above a 50%, and while the teacher scaled up our grades in the end, it was still stressful looking at my report card and wondering whether I would pass
the class. Though Tax Law did actually teach me a lot about how the tax system works, I definitely feel that it would have been a much better experience without grades.

Overall, I have mixed feeling about whether schools should get rid of the grading system. On one hand, I feel that, with teachers having to worry less about the performance of
their students, course work could become more flexible. This would lead to classes that focus more on teaching students about important life skills. Removing grades
would also benefit students who are both naturally curious and display an interest in what they are being taught. For these students, the pressure to get good grades likely
hinders their creativity in several areas.

One flaw in Kohn's argument, however, is his assumption that every kid is naturally enthusiastic about learning, an assumption that seems very unlikely given the negative sentiment towards
school. For students who dislike learning and would rather be doing anything else, the conseqences of failure may be the only thing that keeps them from skipping class entirely. 
Therefore, I believe that the best option for professors is to figure out which end of this spectrum their students fall under before determining how much emphasis should be 
placed on grades. If schools can figure out a way get all of their students excited about learning, then maybe one day, the grading system will become a thing of the past.
